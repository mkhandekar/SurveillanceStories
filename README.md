SurveillanceStories
===================

Meghana Khandekar's thesis project at SVA IXD.

When Edward Snowden leaked his first NSA documents, the world finally learned of the size and reach of the US and world surveillance programs. But after the initial alarm that comes with every news report, interest fades, because surveillance culture is portrayed in media as a policy and data-centric topic. There is a lack of personal connection with the public conversation and news cycle about it. 

Very simply, surveillance is complicated, and people are not yet sure what it means to them, what it could mean some day, and what they can do about it. Surveillance Stories is a platform that makes sense of our surveillance culture through personal storytelling.
