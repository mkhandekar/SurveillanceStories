## Overview

Surveillance Stories is an interactive web platform that transforms abstract surveillance policy into tangible human experiences. Created in response to Edward Snowden's NSA revelations, the project addresses the disconnect between surveillance as a policy issue and its real impact on individuals' lives.

## The Problem

When Edward Snowden leaked his first NSA documents in 2013, the world learned about the size and reach of US and global surveillance programs. However, after initial alarm, public interest faded because:

- **Surveillance is portrayed as abstract** - data-centric policy discussions don't resonate emotionally
- **Lack of personal connection** - people struggle to understand how surveillance affects them directly
- **Complexity barrier** - the technical and legal aspects are overwhelming
- **Unclear implications** - citizens don't know what surveillance means today or could mean in the future

## The Solution

Surveillance Stories bridges this gap by creating a platform for **personal storytelling** that:

1. **Humanizes surveillance** through real experiences
2. **Makes abstract concepts tangible** through narrative
3. **Builds empathy** by connecting surveillance to everyday life
4. **Empowers understanding** of what surveillance means personally

## Project Goals

- Transform surveillance from a distant policy issue into relatable human stories
- Help people understand surveillance's impact through lived experiences
- Create a space for dialogue about privacy, security, and civil liberties
- Make surveillance culture accessible to a general audience

## Technical Implementation

### Built With
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Responsive web interface
- **JavaScript** - Interactive storytelling elements
- **Foundation Framework** - Responsive grid and components
- **Custom interactions** - Scroll-based animations and transitions

### Project Structure

```
SurveillanceStories/
├── Foundation/          # Foundation framework files
├── css/                 # Custom stylesheets
├── js/                  # JavaScript interactions
├── story1.html          # Individual story pages
├── story2.html
├── index_*.html         # Various design iterations
└── README.md
```

### Design Iterations

The repository includes multiple design explorations:
- `index_dots.html` - Dot-based navigation concept
- `index_vertical.html` - Vertical scrolling narrative
- `index_April25.html` / `index_April28.html` - Development milestones
- `index_dots_forloop.html` - Programmatic dot generation experiments

## Features

### Interactive Storytelling
- Scroll-based narrative progression
- Visual metaphors for surveillance concepts
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth transitions between story sections

### User Experience
- Clean, accessible interface
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Emphasis on readability and comprehension
- Navigation that mirrors the complexity of surveillance

## Development Journey

This thesis project explored how interaction design can make complex sociopolitical issues more accessible. The various HTML iterations in the repository document the design evolution from initial concepts to final implementation.

## Context & Inspiration

**Historical Context:**
- June 2013: Edward Snowden leaks classified NSA documents
- Global debate erupts about mass surveillance programs
- Public struggles to understand personal implications
- Media coverage focuses on policy rather than people

**Design Approach:**
- User research with individuals affected by surveillance
- Iterative prototyping of interaction models
- Testing narrative structures for maximum impact
- Balancing information density with emotional resonance

## Setup & Usage

### Viewing the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkhandekar/SurveillanceStories.git
   cd SurveillanceStories
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   ```bash
   # Open any HTML file directly, e.g.:
   open story1.html
   # or
   open index_April28.html
   ```

3. **Run a local server** (recommended for full functionality)
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

   # Then visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Exploring Design Iterations

Navigate through the various `index_*.html` files to see how the project evolved:
1. Start with `index_April25.html` - early design direction
2. View `index_dots.html` - exploration of visual metaphors
3. Check `index_vertical.html` - alternative navigation approach
4. Compare iterations to see decision-making process

## Impact & Outcomes

This thesis project demonstrates how:
- **Interaction design** can make abstract issues tangible
- **Personal narratives** create empathy and understanding
- **Web-based storytelling** reaches broad audiences
- **Design research** informs socially conscious work

## Academic Context

**Institution:** School of Visual Arts (SVA)
**Program:** MFA Interaction Design
**Year:** 2014-2015
**Thesis Advisor:** [Advisor Name if applicable]

## Key Takeaways

1. **Storytelling as design tool** - Narrative is essential for complex topics
2. **Iteration matters** - Multiple explorations lead to stronger solutions
3. **Context is critical** - Understanding historical moment informs design
4. **Empathy through design** - Interaction can build understanding

## Future Directions

While this is an archived thesis project, potential extensions could include:
- [ ] Updated stories reflecting current surveillance landscape
- [ ] Interactive data visualizations of surveillance statistics
- [ ] Community contribution platform for new stories
- [ ] Integration with current privacy advocacy organizations
- [ ] Mobile-native experience
- [ ] Accessibility enhancements (ARIA, screen reader optimization)
